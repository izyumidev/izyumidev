Hi, I'm Yumi Izumi. A self-taught programmer, advocating to make privacy an actual human right.

I'm always looking for interesting ideas to solve issues with technology :)

Currently, I'm learning Rust personally and studying Cybersecurity at Penn State.

Some programming stuff I'm confident with: TypeScript (and JS), Astro, React, Rust, Swift, Ionic, HTML/CSS, SQL, Git, and Java.
